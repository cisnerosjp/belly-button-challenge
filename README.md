## The Task
In this challange we are tasked to build an interactive dashboard which explores data from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels (belly buttons). https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/
First, we had to read in the D3 library from a provided URL which was https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json
Second, we had to create a bar chart with the data that was read in.
Third, we had to create a bubble chart with the same data we read in from the earlier step.
Fourth, we had to display the metadata for the data that was selected. 
Lastly, we had to make it to where the charts would adjust whenever a new Test Subject was selected in the drop down.


## Navigating this repository
You can find a the code for this repository in the starter_Code folder. This folder holds the completed code in the static/js folder, as well as the index.html which I had to update to get the website to run without error. The app.js file in the js folder which is in the folder static/js contains the javascript code which makes all the dashboard work. In order to get it to run locally you have to run index.html and from there it will read the javascript file. There are a few files and folders that were from the starter code which was downloaded from the module 14 challenge page such as the images folder and the data folder which contains the samples.json file.

## Data Provided
For this tasks we were provided starter code that contains a completed index.html file and an app.js file that we have to adjust in order to create the dashboard required in the challenge. There were additional files and folders that were provided in the starter code. The sample data used was from the URL provided in the Module 14 challenge instructions page: "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json". 

## Code Sources
The code in this repository was sourced from starter code provided by the bootcamp as well as from in-class work and activities, and documentation libraries for HTML, JavaScript, and more for certain aspects of this challenge. At times I did have to utilize google for simple queries and information as well as the Plotly.js documentation in order to see how to build the dashboard. I also had to make use of MDN for more info when it came to JavaScript and HTML.
